# CS375B-8 Group Project: Hash Tables

## Project Topic:
Comparing hashing functions, chaining, linear probing, and quadratic probing, performance differences between division/multiplication

## Performance Metrics:
Completion time

Scaling with input size

Collision Count

## Tests:

Insertion of randomized `unsigned int` vectors of varying size

Deletion of a random subset of the input array

Load-factor computation (for linked list)

## Additional Goals/Requirements

All commits must compile with `-Ofast -Wall -Wextra -pedantic` as specified in the Makefile

Tests will be parallelized using the pthread API to save runtime

Project will be compiled and run on remoteCS
